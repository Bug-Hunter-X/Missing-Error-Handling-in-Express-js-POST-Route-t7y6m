# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for missing request bodies in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The original code lacks checks to ensure a request body is present before processing it. If a client sends a POST request without a body, the application will either throw an error or behave unexpectedly, leading to potential crashes or data inconsistencies.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation to check if `req.body` exists and contains the necessary data before processing it. Appropriate error responses are sent to the client in case of invalid input, providing a better user experience and application robustness.
